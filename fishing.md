## Crankbait
Most times, a crank and pause retrieve will outfish a straight retrieve. Fish the lure more with the rod than the reel. Pull the lure forward by sweeping the rod in a stop-and-go motion and take up line as the rod is moved forward to repeat the process.

## Jig
To use a jig, cast near known underwater structure, or in the flow of an incoming stream and work the jig with short jerks of the rod while slowly reeling in your line. The jerk works the jig up and down as it approaches shore in the manner of a baitfish trying to elude predators.

## Spinner
A spinner is among the easiest lures to use. Just cast and retrieve, you don’t need to jerk the rod, or flip it up or down, just turn the handle on your reel and let the lure do its work. You can adjust the depth of the spinner by slowing down your retrieve for deeper use or cranking faster to keep the lure at shallower depths.

## Spoon
Great for predators typically found on deep structure. Let the spoon freefall down. When it hits bottom, take up slack line until the rod tip is a foot above the water, then work the spoon with short jerks up and down. Usually, strikes occur when the spoon is falling, so be ready.
- Try a red, yellow, or orange spoon if the water and light are clear and bright.
- If the water is murky, or the light is low, use a blue, indigo, or violet spoon.
- Use a silver spoon on a cloudless day. The reflected sun on the spoon will make attractive bait.

## Topwater
To use a topwater lure you have to make an accurate cast near cattails, willows, lily pads, or overhanging brush. Often you’ll get a strike as soon as the lure hits the water, but jerking the popper a few feet, reeling in line, then jerking again extends the attraction on each cast. This is a fabulous bass lure.

## Swimbait
This type of lure is designed for fish over 10 lbs. You must reel in the swimbait slowly. 

## Soft Plastic
To use a soft plastic bait, cast it into open water and let it sink for a few seconds. Jerk lightly and retrieve in still water. In slow-moving water, you can jerk lightly then allow the current to pull the line tight, then jerk again. This stationary jerking motion is a natural way to present bait suspended in thermal layers of water.

## Blade
This is an easy lure to fish since it only requires a constant retrieval rate. You can jerk and pop ta blade bait for more action, but the retrieve is often enough. These are painted to match minnows, sunfish fry, or bluegill fry, matching these popular baitfish.
