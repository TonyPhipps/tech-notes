Supplies
- Safety glasses

- Pressure washer (capable of 1800psi)
- Sharp knife
- Five-gallon bucket
- Dish soap
- Large paintbrush
- Tanning formula
- 3 lbs salt
- Sandpaper

Steps
- Secure hide so it can be sprayed without moving the hide itself.
- Tan the hide with 1800 PSI, keeping the stream moving so as to avoid ripping a hole.
  - Alternatively, cut and pull off the meat from the hide by hand with a sharp knife.
  - Consider cutting off the edges if meat is stuck in the hair to may it far less likely to smell in those areas and be stiff.
- Pour salt liberally over the flesh side of the hide until it's completely covered.
- Grab the 5g bucket. Fold the hide, flesh side together, and roll it up. Put it in the bucket. The bucket is crucial as it will help catch any moisture that leaks out of the hide.
- Leave the hide for 24 hours.
- Shake the old salt off, and reapply fresh salt in the same way.
- Fold flesh sides together again, roll and place in the five-gallon bucket.
- Leave it for 24 hours (again).
- Mix a salt bath in a separate bucket with enough water to immerse the hide. Use 1/2 lb of table salt per gallon of water and extremely hot water to dissolve the salt. Mix thoroughly until salt is dissolved.
- Let the water cool.
- Immerse the hide in the brine solution and leave for six to eight hours. If left too long, the hair will start falling off the hide.
- Remove the hide and make sure there are no remaining pieces of flesh. If there are, simply scrape them off with a sharp knife. This is an important last step as any remaining bits of flesh will eventually make the hide smell if not removed.
- Wash the hide in water and dish soap to remove all excess grease and salt. You can reuse your five-gallon bucket and use your hands to wash and move the hide around. 
- Rinse the hide off with a hose or in the tub until there are no remaining soap bubbles.
- Drape it over a railing or clothesline (hair side down), and let it drip dry until the hide is only slightly damp and still pliable. Might take a day or two.
- Warm the tanning solution for 30min in hot tap water in a pot.
- Lay the hide open, flesh side up.
- Wearing gloves, apply the solution directly from the bottle to the hide. Pour small amounts at a time onto the hide and use a large paintbrush or gloved hands to spread it around. It's important to make sure you cover every bit of the flesh with the solution.
- Massage it in and fold the flesh sides together again. 
- Leave overnight 12 hours and then open the hide and let it continue drying. Keep in mind that the formula has an odor. Although it's not totally bad (similar to musty wet leather), you'll want to keep the smell in mind when storing the hide during this process. It will quickly permeate a room. I suggest putting the hide in the garage, basement, or shed where no animals can get to it.
- During this drying time, you'll want to work the hide while it is still slightly damp to make it soft and pliable. Start working it as soon as its not overly sticky. Skip this step, and your hide will be as stiff as a board. Work the hide during the next roughly 2-3 days as it dries completely.
  - To work it, stretch and fold the hide in all directions. Pulling it back and forth (flesh side down) over a taut rope or hard surface such as a railing, fence, or concrete. 
- When the hide is completely dry, sand it with corse-grit sandpaper—either by hand or with an electric palm sander—on the tanned-flesh side to soften it even more.
