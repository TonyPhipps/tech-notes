# Food Sources
- South- and west-facing slopes. These slopes get the most sunlight → earlier green-up in spring and more tender forage into fall. Use the Hybrid (satellite + topo) view.
- Slopes facing south/west. Often have sage, bitterbrush, or grasses — prime early/late feed zones. More active on these slopes just after dawn and before dark.
- Meadows. bright green or tan patches amid timber, often flat benches or drainages.
- Recent burns. Toggle the “Historic Wildfires” layer — target areas 1–5 years post-burn.
- Transition zones. Deer like edges between thick timber (cover) and open feed (visibility trade-off). Trace where dark forest meets lighter open slope. Look for finger ridges and benches that have mixed vegetation.

# Bedding Areas
- North- and east-facing slopes. Cooler, shaded, less wind — ideal for daytime bedding.
- On the topo view, these slopes are opposite your south-facing feed zones.
- Often mid-elevation benches halfway between valley bottoms and ridge tops.
- Dense, uniform dark-green canopy on satellite = mature timber / thick cover.
- Benches and finger ridges. These give deer security + a view + quick escape routes. On topo, look for subtle flattening in contour lines (a little plateau before a drop-off).
- Trace finger ridges that branch from main ridgelines — deer bed along sides just below the crest.
- Track thermal & wind advantage. Midday, air rises up-slope; evening, it falls down-slope. Bucks bed where they can smell both up and down the hill.
- Place bedding guesses on slopes where prevailing winds cross thermals — e.g., north-facing benches near ridges or just below saddles.

# Water Sources
- Creeks & springs. Water becomes sparse at higher elevations late in summer.
- Topo "blue lines" = perennial or seasonal creeks. Mark tributaries that feed into creeks, rivers, etc.
- Zoom in on contour lines where small blue dashes appear or where vegetation is lush green compared to surroundings. Mark as drainages.
- Look for v-shaped draws with greener satellite coloration.
- In burned or open country, seeps often appear as tiny clusters of bright green shrubs.
- Troughs / tanks / stock ponds. Ranch or Forest Service installations can hold water late into the season.
- Toggle the "Gov’t Lands" and "Waypoints" layers.
- Look for circular or rectangular dark spots near trails or two-tracks — small man-made ponds. These can hold both deer and elk sign.
