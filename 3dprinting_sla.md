# Cleaning
- IPA works ok
- Ethanol works better
- Mean Green is a good budget option among various "degreaser" comparisons

Mercury X Wash and Cure Bundle
- Typically wash and cure each for 5-6min. Increase for higher print complexity, possibly moving/flipping in the cure station every 2-3min
- Filter out and cure waste after 30 uses.

## Layout
- Drag model into window
- Move > Click On Platform
- Rotate > Angle the model backwards 40-50 degrees, so the parts you want to see most are not suported (e.g. faces)
  - Sometimes tipping a bit more, less, to the left or right is helpful.
