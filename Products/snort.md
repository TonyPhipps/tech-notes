## Limitation
- Snort rules may lack the fidelity to scrutinize the packets/stream with the granularity needed.
- You can identify only what rules language options can detect.
- Snort lacks the capability to perform correlation across time and systems.
- Snort lacks some important application decode capabilities.
- Snort 2 and 3 seem to have a hard limit of five alerts per packet.
