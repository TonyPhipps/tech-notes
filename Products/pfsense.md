# Setting Up pfSense as a Home Router/Firewall
Assumes you are using a Netgate SG-1100


## Initial Setup
- Plug in power and cable between PC and LAN interface
- Wait ~5min
- Navigate to 192.168.1.1

  - Run through the setup wizard with all defaults
  - Primary DNS server suggestion - [OpenDNS](https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/228006047-Generalized-Router-Configuration-Instructions)


## Basic Firewall Setup
The pfSense firewall blocks WAN traffic by default - any traffic that doesn't match any rules is dropped silently.


### Default-deny Outbound
This is basically hard-mode. You will have to create Pass rules above this rule to get anything working. We'll put in Pass rules for basic internet over TCP 80/443

- Navigate to Firewall > Rules > LAN
  - Add these rules
    - Pass tcp any 443
    - Pass tcp any 80
    - Pass any LAN net LAN net
    - Block IPv4+IPv6 protocol:any LAN Net any (enable logging)
  - Click Apply Changes
  - Review any blocks via Status > System Logs > Firewall


## DNS Blocking


### Firewall DNS Setup
- Navigate to Firewall > Rules > LAN
  - Traffic is parsed through firewall rules top-to-bottom. We will make two rules here. One to allow DNS to the pfSense system, and one UNDER it to block all DNS.
  - Add a rule:
    - Action: Pass
    - Protocol: UDP
    - Source: Any
    - Destination LAN Net / DNS (53)
    - Description: Allow DNS to pfSense
