# Windows

## Installation
- Best to check all the logs during installation rather than after installation.
- Set any user/password you like. This is to modify the configuration on the specific machine.
- Deployment Server - You should be able to confirm access to this port via web. e.g. http://server:8089 and get a response.
- Receiving Indexer - This one won't have a web frontend.
  - NOTE: A server must be configured to receive on this port in order to actually receive the data sent by this client.
