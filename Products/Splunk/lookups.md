# Review a Lookup Table
```
| inputlookup mylookup
```

# Determine if the contents of a field are in a lookup
Note: I have found it more helpful to rename the fields from the INPUTLOOKUP rather than the search, as this approach avoids editing the active search fields with this exclusion is placed where it's needed in the larger saerch.

- Where the inputlookup has a field named dest_ip and the search has a field named IP

```
[| inputlookup ioc_ip.csv | fields IP | rename dest_ip as IP ]
```


# Save Output to a Lookup
Create initial lookup table in user context to allow permissions to be set
```
 | outputlookup "your_lookup.csv" create_context=user
```

A saved search can then be created with this at the end, which will overwrite the lookup when the search executes on a schedule.
```
| `output_adb_lookup("your_lookup.csv")`
```

- Create Lookup Definition
  - Advanced Options > Match Type: "CIDR(subnet)"
- Add to search to find NON matches (assuming label is ALWAYS provided)
````
| lookup net_trusted subnet AS src_ip index AS index OUTPUT subnet_label AS subnet_label_src
| lookup net_trusted subnet AS dst_ip index AS index OUTPUT subnet_label AS subnet_label_dst
| eval Subnet = case(
  isnull(subnet_label_src), "Source Unrecognized",
  isnull(subnet_label_dst), "Destination Unrecognized"
)
| where like(Subnet, "%Unrecognized")
