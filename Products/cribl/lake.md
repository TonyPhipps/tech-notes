# Lake Concepts: Lake Basics
This section provides a comprehensive overview of how Cribl Lake addresses common data lake issues by providing a streamlined data management solution.


## Data Lakes and data management challenges
Data management challenges grow alongside ever-increasing data volumes. Traditional methods, like schema-based storage, become costly and inflexible as data sources diversify. Data lakes offer a central repository but introduce delays and security concerns. Traditional data storage solutions struggle with:

- Cost and complexity: Schema-based approaches become expensive and difficult to manage as data sources evolve.
- Data lake limitations: Data lakes can introduce delays in data collection, formatting, and retrieval. Security concerns arise due to potentially limited access controls and data masking.
- Tiered storage challenges: Implementing a tiered storage strategy for long-term storage is often resource-intensive and requires specialized expertise.
- Data rehydration complexity: Rehydrating and routing data for further analysis adds another layer of cost and complexity.
